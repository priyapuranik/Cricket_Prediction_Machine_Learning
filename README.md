# Cricket_Prediction_Machine_Learning

Cricket Match Outcome Predictor is a machine learning-powered web application designed to predict the outcome of a cricket match.<br> Users can input details like the batting and bowling teams, the city where the match is taking place, runs left, balls left, wickets left, total runs, current run rate, and required run rate.<br>The application uses a decision tree model to predict whether the batting team will win the match. This project is built with Flask for the backend and deployed on AWS, providing a user-friendly interface for cricket enthusiasts and analysts.<br>

1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
<li>Description:<br></li>
In this section, I explored the dataset to understand its structure and identify any patterns or anomalies. I examined various features such as the teams, match location, and in-game statistics like runs, wickets, and balls remaining. The EDA process helped in identifying correlations between different features and the outcome of the match, which guided feature selection for the model.

2) Data Cleaning<br>
<li>Description:</li><br>
Data cleaning involved handling missing values, correcting inconsistent data, and preparing the dataset for modeling. This step ensured that the data was accurate, consistent, and free from errors, making it suitable for building reliable predictive models.
